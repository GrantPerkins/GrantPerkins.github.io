		My favorite extracurricular is FIRST Robotics. At my sending school,
		Algonquin Regional High School, I was the lead programmer during the
		2018 season. Here is 1100's <a
			href="https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/1100">Blue Alliance</a>
		page.<br /> <br />On team 190, Mass Academy's robotics team, I am
		Chief of Controls and driver. This means that I am in charge of all
		things electrical and software. While this job was previously held by
		a WPI senior, my previous experience on team 1100 qualified me for
		this position. This year, I automated almost all robot functionality.
		Our robot climbs an 18" box, picks up balls and panels, and can drive
		semi-autonomously. It uses vision tracking to automatically line up
		with all game elements. Below is a video of our climb.</br>

	<h2>What is programming, for robotics?</h2>
	<p>
		Every piece of hardware is consciously controlled by code. Student
		programmers have access to simple methods courtesy of the WPILib API
		which control all the hardware. Another task for the programmers is
		interpreting input. During the teleoperated mode, the drivers of the
		robot move joysticks and press buttons, which the robot must interpret
		into physical movement. <br />

	<h2>Autonomous</h2>
	<p>The first fifteen seconds of a match are in the autonomous mode.
		This means that the drivers cannot give any input. Code controls the
		robot to drive the robot to predetermined paths, to accomplish set
		goals. Interesting things I have done in auto include motion profiling
		and vision tracking.</p>
