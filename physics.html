	<h1>Physics</h1>
	<p>In physics, we study a variety of topics from kinematics to
		magnetism. We take notes, and do labs, demos, and sometimes tests.</p>
	<h2>Uber Problems</h2>
	<p>
		At the end of many chapters in physics, I am tasked with solving an
		especially complex problem called an “Uber Problem”. These problems
		involve many steps and often many attempts to get the correct answer,
		and I must write a two-page report after finishing each one. Below is
		an example report.<br />

	<p>This problem tasked me with finding the coefficient of friction
		of the ground after a guy takes a jump in a sled. The problems often
		have fun themes like this. Our chapter one test was Fortnite themed.</p>
	<h2>Labs</h2>
	<p>I often complete labs in my physics class. One of our earliest
		labs had me dropping a penny to determine the acceleration of gravity.
		While my results may have been far off the expected 9.8 meters per
		square seconds, the lab was fun and it was good practice for designing
		future labs. Below is my lab report.</p>
