	<h1>Computer Science</h1>
	<p>In the computer science class at Mass Academy, we make websites
		(like this one), learn Java, and participate in a mobile app
		development challenge.</p>
	<h2>RattleSnake</h2>
	<p>
		I am part of the Advanced CS track at Mass Academy. Because of my
		prior experience with computer science, I tested out of the standard
		class, and I can work on an interesting project instead. My project is
		called RattleSnake, which is a new compiled language with roots in
		Python and C++. Shown below is the code for the lexical analysis and
		parsing, written in Python 3.6. <br />
	</p>

	<div class=center>
		<object data="docs/compiler.pdf" type="application/pdf" width=425
			height=550> </object>
	</div>

	<p>

		I take a RattleSnake file, <a href="docs/test3.rsnake">like this
			one</a>, and convert the raw text into a list of tokens. This is called
		lexical analysis. I then parse this list, to make an abstract syntax
		tree which represents the entire program. Finally, assembly code is
		generated from the tree and linked, and is run as a .exe.<br/ > <br/ >
	</p>
	<h2>Apps for Good</h2>
	<p>My group’s Apps for Good project involved the Seven Hills Switch
		Choir, and is a joint project with STEM 2. The Switch Choir is an
		ensemble where people with physical disabilities preventing them from
		playing traditional instruments have the opportunity to play music by
		activating switches. Typical switches are oversized buttons or levers,
		which is suitable for some musicians but not those who lack gross
		motor skills, such as those who are paralyzed.<img id="me" src="images/ui.png" alt="a picture of our ui"> Our project was to
		create an Android app that tracked the location of the musician’s
		nose, and interpret that location as a musical note. It uses the
		OpenCV API to track the nose, and runs at about 5 frames per second on
		7 Hills’ tablet. Users are effectively able to not only compose but
		record their music as well.Our app supports recording and exporting
		songs natively. The simple, colorful UI maintains the user’s
		attention, but also is easy comprehensible. </p>
	
	<p>
	<h2>ACSL</h2>
	<p>Another thing I do in the Computer Science class is the American
		Computer Science League Competition. Every month I compete in the
		Senior League (despite being a junior), where I answer a few test
		questions and one programming question. Below is my solution to the
		most recent programming problem.</p>
	<div class=center>
		<object data="docs/acsl.pdf" type="application/pdf" width=425
			height=550> </object>
	</div>
	<p>The question was to take a number and a length, then group the
		number into groups of that length and sum those numbers. The
		challenges will get more difficult later in the year.</p>
	<h2>Outside of School</h2>
	<img id="win" src="images/win.jpg"
		alt="a picture of my team with our plaque">
	<p>
		Out of school, I do lots of programming. I am fluent in Python and
		comfortable with Java. My favorite projects have been using machine
		learning to identify handwritten digits, and a web scaper that
		downloads news articles in plaintext. I also compete in <a
			href="https://picoctf.com/about">picoCTF</a>. Another competition I
		participated in was the Fitchburg State University Programming
		Competition. I won it in the spring of my freshman year.
