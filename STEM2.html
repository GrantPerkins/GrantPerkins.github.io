	<h1>STEM 2</h1>
	<p>Juniors at MAMS, during C and D term, work in partnership with a
		charitable organization to create a product to help people with
		disabilities. These products typically are hardware-focused.</p>
	<h2>Music Motions</h2>
	<p>
		My STEM 2 project was in combination with my Apps for Good project. TO
		learn more about our app go <a href="CS.html">here.</a> The hardware
		side of our project was to create a portable battery holder to mount
		our battery to the tablet stand. This allows the user to use our
		product for an additional hour at least. Below is a picture of our app
		and prototypes.

			id="stem2" src="images/proto.png" alt="a picture of our prototypes">We
		3D printed our battery holders, and CAD'd them ourselves in
		SolidWorks. The current version holds our battery perfectly. At some
		point, we may add a lid to the top of the case, in case it goes
		upside-down.
