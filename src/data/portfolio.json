    "description": "The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) has a commitment to providing their customers transparent performance measures. To aid in this commitment, this project predicts whether the Red Line will be late, given just 2 weeks of historical data on the other rapid transit lines. The MBTA Reliability dataset was split into disjoint training and testing sets. An exhaustive search of methods of scaling, feature decomposition, and models was performed, as well as five-fold cross validation. This produced PCA into random forest pipeline capable of 61% accuracy on predicting if the Red Line will be late. Additional models explored include GRU, LSTM, SVM, and logistic regression.",

    "description": "In its semi-strong form, the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) implies that technical analysis will not reveal any hidden statistical trends via intermarket data analysis. If technical analysis on intermarket data reveals trends which can be leveraged to significantly outperform the stock market, then the semi-strong EMH does not hold. In this work, we utilize a variety of machine learning techniques to empirically evaluate the EMH using stock market, foreign currency (Forex), international government bond, index future, and commodities future assets. We train five machine learning models on each dataset and analyze the average performance of these models for predicting the direction of future S&P 500 movement as approximated by the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF (SPY). From our analysis, the datasets containing bonds, index futures, and/or commodities futures data notably outperform baselines by substantial margins. Further, we find that the usage of intermarket data induce statistically significant positive impacts on the accuracy, macro F1 score, weighted F1 score, and area under receiver operating characteristic curve for a variety of models at the 95% confidence level. This provides strong empirical evidence contradicting the semi-strong EMH.",

    "image": "gan.png",
    "description": "The accuracy of existing face detection and recognition models are greatly compromised when obstructions, like surgical masks, occlude facial features of the individual. This paper introduces a method which uses facial reconstruction as a new entry for face detection in a mask-wearing context. In the first phase of the model, an object detection network, called EfficientDet-D0, locates the position of the mask. In the second phase, a Gated Convolutional Network and SN-PatchGAN model, in a Generative Adversarial Network, work collaboratively to reconstruct the occluded region of the face. The EfficientDet-D0 model successfully detects masks with a prediction score of 0.966 mAP with an IoU threshold of 50%. The GAN was trained successfully and reconstructed the outline of a human face, but failed to reproduce detailed facial features due to time and hardware constraints.",

My Python script trained a custom convolutional neural network, calculating loss using cross entropy across all workers. The lead worker ran the optimizer",
