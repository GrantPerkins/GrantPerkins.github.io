		<p>
			My name is Grant and I am a student at Mass Academy, class of 2020. I
			live in Southborough, Massachusetts. Before Mass Academy, I went to
			Algonquin Regional High School. My favorite subject is computer
			science. Outside of school, my favorite things to do are fishing,
			playing the saxophone, and hanging out with my friends. I was also an
			invested member of my old school's robotics team. It was part of <a
				href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc">FIRST Robotics
				Competition</a>. I also did Programming Team at Algonquin. My team won
			the 2017 Spring Fitchburg Programming Competition. I solved two of
			the six problems on the four person team. My other teammates were all
			seniors. <br />

		<h2>Volunteering</h2>
		<img src="images/dance.jpg" id="me2" alt="a cute picture of me" />
		<p>I have done a lot of volunteering this year. I have volunteered
			for the Southborough Youth and Family Services Summer Concert Series,
			Special Olympics, and Robotics. For the concerts, I sold t-shirts to
			help pay for underprivileged kids' summer camp. With Special
			Olympics, I was a referee for bocce and an announcer for softball.
			With robotics, I volunteered at many FIRST LEGO League competitions,
			and did field reset for the FIRST Robotics Competition New England
			District Championship. The vast majority of my volunteer hours came
			from robotics, as most of the events were multi-day, day-long events.</p>
		<h2>Saxophone</h2>
		<p>
			I've played my saxophone for 6 six years. I started playing jazz in
			seventh grade. I was lead alto in the Central District Junior Jazz
			Band. I was in Algonquin's Jazz II and Jazz I before I came to Mass
			Academy. While I may not listen to jazz for fun, I really enjoy
			playing it in a band. Genres of jazz I've played before include
			Be-Bop, Ballads, and Latin. The great thing about high school bands
			is that one is able to play a large variety of jazz without much
			commitment to one specific genre. At Mass Academy, I still play my
			saxophone despite the workload. I am a member of WPI's Jazz Workshop,
			a class dedicated to increasing students' ability in playing jazz. I
			will be able to learn a lot of things from this course, including how
			to better improvise over chord changes. If you are interested in
			joining this ensemble, <a

		<h2>Fishing</h2>
		<p>
			<img src="images/fish.jpg" alt="a big ol' fish that you can't see" />
			Fishing is one of my favorite hobbies. My biggest fish is a Northern
			Pike that was 32 inches and 6.8lbs. I've been fishing since I was
			four, when I first cast a hookless lure into a pond full of frogs.
			Since then, I have traveled all over New England and Canada in search
			of big fish. This summer I went to the Belgrade Lakes region in Maine
			in search of monster smallmouth bass. My largest smallmouth was
			19.5in and 4lbs. Other places where I have fished include Northern
			Ontario Canada and the Kennebec River. <br />
