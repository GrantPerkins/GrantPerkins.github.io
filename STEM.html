	<h1>STEM</h1>
	<p>Every student at Mass Academy is required to have a science
		project. We spend a month deciding on a project, and then we present
		our projects at the fair in February.</p>
	<h2>Science Project</h2>
	<p>

		My science project is titled <b>Accurate Centroid-Determining
			Human Body Detection</b>. I am using three neural networks to more
		accurately determine the location of people within depth images. At
		the time of writing, I have two of my three neural networks done. I
		chose this project because I am interested in the fields of computer
		vision and machine learning, and I wanted to have some experience
		before I committed myself to this path in college. Below is the code
		for one of my neural networks, called a sparse auto-encoder.<br />

	<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
	<p>Current centroid-determining human body detection algorithms
		using RGB-D images are only up to 95% accurate. Applications for this
		technology, ranging from security systems to video gaming, require
		higher accuracy.</p>
	<h3>Engineering Goal</h3>
	<p>The algorithm developed for this project will be more accurate
		than existing algorithms, as evidenced by decreased percent error in
		bounding box sizes and locations and low distance between calculated
		and actual centroids.</p>
	<h3>Abstract</h3>
	<p>Video calling platforms, security systems, and video games all
		use human body detection, but inaccurate methods of locating the human
		lower the overall accuracy of this technology. To improve this
		technology from the current 95% maximum accuracy, a Sparse
		Auto-Encoder (SAE) and convolutional neural network (CNN) were used
		with Sliding Window Localization (SWL) to locate the centroids of
		human bodies. Depth images were taken with an Xbox Kinect. The SAE
		learns the human body features of a depth image dataset, which are
		then used by the CNN to determine the human-body features of the
		Kinect’s image. A histogram was then generated, and the centroids of
		similar valued regions were found. SWL was used to then determine
		which region’s centroid represented a human. This method has an
		accuracy of 54.856%. This algorithm can be used in all systems where
		locating a human body within an image is crucial.</p>
	<h3>Summary of Work</h3>
	<p>I used 3 neural networks for this project: a Sparse
		Auto-Encoder, a Convolutional Neural Network, and a binary human
		classifier. I used an additional Python file to test the accuracy of
		the centroid determination using a False Positives Per View algorithm.
		This algorithm compares the union and intersection of the actual and
		experimental bounding boxes of the human. Unfortunately, my project
		ended up being only 55% accurate, as determined by FPPV. This
		algorithm is not more accurate than current algorithms, but I learned
		a lot about machine learning, which was valuable to me. My summer job
		will be in the field of machine learning, partially because of this
		project.</p>
	<h2>Statistics</h2>
	<p>In the actual STEM class, we learn about different parts of the
		research process as we go through our projects. One unit, we focused
		on statistics. As a group project, I worked with some of my friends on
		a presentation where we discussed when one should use a paired or
		unpaired T-test. Below is that presentation.</p>
