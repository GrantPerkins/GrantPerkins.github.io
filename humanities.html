	<h1>Humanities</h1>
	<p>At Mass Academy, history and English classes are merged into one
		humanities class. This allows for us to explore a variety of different
		concepts in class, from ancient Troy to satire to racial issues in
		America.</p>
	<h2>Bradbury</h2>
	<p>
		One of my favorite essays that I had to write was comparing two of
		renowned science fiction writer Ray Bradbury’s pieces, “The
		Pedestrian” and “August 2026: There Come Soft Rain”. Science fiction
		is one of my favorite genres of literature, which made this assignment
		especially enjoyable for me. Below is my essay.<br />

	<h2>Troy</h2>
	<p>
		Another essay that I wrote was comparing Homer’s <i>The Illiad</i> and
		Euripides’ <i>Women of Troy</i>. I used to be heavily invested in
		Greek mythology when I was younger, so I had a lot of background
		knowledge going into the essay. It is attached below.
