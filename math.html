	<h1>Math</h1>
	<p>In mathematical modeling, we do open ended problems that can be
		modeled mathematically, and cover topics taught in pre-calculus
		courses.</p>
	<h2>HiMCM</h2>
	<p>
		This November I competed with my team in the High School Mathematical
		Competition in Modeling. This competition presented us two problems,
		of which we could choose to spend the next 36 hours solving. My team
		decided to choose the problem about roller coasters. The question
		asked us to develop a method of determining how thrilling a roller
		coaster a given roller coaster is, given many specifications about the
		roller coaster including the maximum height, speed, and distance. It
		also asked us to rank the top 10 roller coasters, design a mobile app
		to find roller coasters, and write a fake news report summarizing our
		work. Below is our report.<br />

	<h2>Hanford</h2>
	<p>Another activity I did in my math class was a lab on lines of
		fit. It was called Hanford. This lab tasked me with finding any
		correlation between exposure to radioactive contamination and deaths
		from cancer. I used three different lines of fit for this lab. These
		lines were two-point, median-median, and least squares. The below
		document is the Mathematica notebook containing the lab report.</p>
