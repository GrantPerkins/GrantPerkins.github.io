	<h2>Research Plan</h2>
	<p>
		Science and Technical Writing is a class that prepares me for formal
		research in our field. I have been practicing reading research papers
		and writing scientific work. This class also works with my science
		project. One of the first pieces I worked on was my research plan for
		my science project, in order to get approval to begin working on it.

	<h2>Literature Review</h2>
	<p>A large part of STW is writing the dreaded literature review.
		This document summarizes anything one needs to know in order to
		understand my project. It had a maximum length of 10 pages, and
		honestly I wish I couldâ€™ve written more. In my literature review, I
		talk about the kind of images I use, the API I use, existing
		algorithms for determining the centroids of humans in images, and the
		algorithm of which I am modifying. This can be read below.</p>
